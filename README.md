## About the Project

Mental health conditions affect millions of people worldwide, and early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project aims to create a machine learning model that can detect signs of mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and stress based on specific input data, such as responses to questionnaires or behavioral data.

The goal of this project is to provide an automated tool that can assist healthcare professionals or individuals in detecting mental health conditions early and with greater accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for the project.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and training machine learning models.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and documentation.
